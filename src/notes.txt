Question we are planning to solve
1. Nearest greater to left
2. Nearest greater to right
3. Nearest smaller to left
4. Nearest smaller to right
5. tock span problem
6. Maximum area of histogram
7. Max area of rectangle in binary matrix
8. Rain water problem
9. Implementing the minstack
10. Implement stack using 
11. The celebrity probelm
12. Longest valid parenthesis

Identification for the stack Question
1. Generally have array 
2. Generally the bruteforce algorithm O(n^2) the internal loop is dependent on outside one

outer loop                   |     inner loop
for(int i=0; i<10; i++)         1. j-> 0 to i | j++
                                2. j-> i to 0 | j--
                                3. j-> i to n | j++
                                4. j-> n to i | j--

Question 1:
Next greatest to left:
Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. 
The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element 
on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element 
exist, consider next greater element as -1.

Approach:
1. Start from the end of array
2. Store the last element in the stack 
3. Now while the top element is smaller than element we want to push remove the top
4. If stack is empty return -1 else stack.top()
